I'm a fourth-year PhD student in machine learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home). My current research interests include **Trustworthy Machine Learning (Privacy)**, **Graph Neural Networks** and **Large Language Models**.

I received my bachelor's degree in Honors Math from [Xi'an Jiao University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).

I'm actively seeking research internship opportunities for summer 2025 and would be grateful for any relevant information or recommendations.
